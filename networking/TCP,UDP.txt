UDP User Datagram Protocol
Features:
  - message - datagram
  - connectionless protocol
  - packet is transmitted independently and may take a different path
  - used for applications that require fast and efficient transmission
  - works by breaking data into packets and adding a header to each packet
  - not provide reliable data transmission or error detection
  - transmit data more quickly and efficiently than TCP
  - IP packet 65515 bites
  - DNS uses UDP/53, DHCP uses UDP/68(client) UDP/67(server)


TCP Transmission Control Protocol
Responsible for:
  - establishing a connection between the source and destination devices
  - breaking data into packets
  - ensuring that packets in the correct order and without errors
  - uses a sliding window mechanism to control the flow of data 
Features:
  - connection-oriented communication
  - flow control
  - error detection and correction (includes a checksum field in the packet header)
  - congestion control (slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit)
Three way handshake:
  - SYN client sends a SYN packet to the server, it wants to establish a connection
  - SYN-ACK server responds with a SYN-ACK packet
  - ACK client sends an ACK packet to the server, ready to begin transmuting data
